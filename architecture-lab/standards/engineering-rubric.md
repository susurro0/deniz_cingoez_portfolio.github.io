# Engineering Competency Rubric (ML & Analytics)

This rubric defines the expectations for growth within the organization. While technical proficiency is the baseline, leadership at the higher levels is measured by **impact, mentorship, and system-level thinking.**

## Level: Senior Engineer (IC3)
* **Technical:** Can architect and deliver a full subgraph (e.g., an entire Inference API) independently.
* **ML Domain:** Understands the difference between software bugs and model drift. Implements robust monitoring by default.
* **Impact:** Identifies "organizational debt" in their squad and proposes a plan to fix it.
* **Mentorship:** Actively reviews PRs with a focus on teaching, not just catching errors.

## Level: Staff Engineer / Lead (IC4)
* **Technical:** Designs systems that span multiple squads. Focuses on the "Paved Path"—making sure other engineers don't have to solve the same problem twice.
* **Strategy:** Contributes to the 3-year Tech Radar. Identifies when a technology (e.g., a specific ML framework) is becoming a liability.
* **Impact:** Responsible for "Definition of Ready" across the domain. Their architecture decisions save the company significant compute/operational costs.
* **Leadership:** Mentors Senior Engineers into leadership roles. Can lead a post-incident review (Blameless Post-mortem) that changes company-wide processes.

*Note: We value "T-Shaped" engineers who have deep ML/Data expertise but a broad understanding of Enterprise Software Engineering (Java/Python/CI-CD).*
